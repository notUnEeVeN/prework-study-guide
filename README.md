# <Coding Camp Pre-work Study Guide>

## Description

This website was created with the intention of introducing me the fundamentals of HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaScript that I will be learning about and using frequently during my coding camp. I was motivated to complete this website as I want to be in the best possible position to get the most out of my coding camp experience, so any experience interacting with the concepts I'll be exposed to will be very beneficial. On top of that, while I have studied a little bit of code on my own, I had never completed an official coding project before, and creating a tangible website I can upload and share with others will be an one of my first major accomplishments for me, which helps motivate me further, and is a far more enjoyable way of learning. I learnt a lot about the process of using git bash and github for file and branch creation/management, and of course the general back end processes of the above listed languages for creating websites as a whole.

## Usage

There is many ways to use this study guide, the most direct and obvious method being, studying, reading, and adding to the notes section of the website, to review the information that I am learning about the topics that will be relevant in my coding camp. The second is using the inspect element console, as well as the back end code, to review and refresh myself more hands on with the concepts we implemented there. Getting more practice using and memorizing the git bash commands and the general syntax and logic of this code will most definitely help down the line.
