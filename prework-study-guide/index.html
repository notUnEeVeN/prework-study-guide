        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that tracks the changes and version history of a source code during software development</li>
          <li>Git allows multiple developers to work on the same code concurrently</li>
          <li>Some common bit commands you will use are: git clone <.repo> creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git status: shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or stages, </li>
          <li>gid add <.file>: adds an untracked or modified file to the staging area</li>
          <li>give commit -m <.message>: commits the staged changes with a descriptive message</li>
          <li>git push: pushes the commited changes to the remote repository</li>
          <li>git pull: fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into the current branch</li>
          <li>git branch: lists all the local branches</li>
          <li>You will use git by creating your own 'branch' isolated from the main code to add/edit code, without it impacting the rest of the main code, when you have completed your work, it gets checked by other developers on the team, and then once approved, merged into the main code, and your branch is deleted.</li>
