        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>IGNORE ALL PERIODS IN THE TAGS, THEY WERE ADDED TO DISABLE THEM SO THEY CAN APPEAR IN THE TEXT</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage used for the backend/broswer/SEO, and is not seen by the user</li>
          <li>The body element represents the content that will be visible to the user</li>
          <li>HTML will be the foundational structure of your website, the first step</li>
          <li>Many HTML commands are semantic, allowing other coders to easily understand the function of a certain command</li>
          <li>HTML commands are enclosed in <>, and often will begin with an start and end tag, such as <.p> and <./p> (without the periods) which would create a paragraph</li>
          <li>DOCTYPE html is a decleration that helps web browsers display web pages correctly</li>
          <li>Common HTML tags: <.h1> through <.h6> for headers, <.p> for a paragraph, <.a> for a hyperlink, <.img> to embed images, <.div> is a container unit that encapsulates other  page elements and divides the HTML document into sections, <.ul> and <.li>: to create unordered lists</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS(cascading style sheets) is used to style and layout web pages (potentially the step after HTML foundation)</li>
          <li>CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed on screen</li>
          <li>Common CSS properties are color, background color, font-family, font-size, border, padding, margin, width and height</li>
          <li>Include more CSS study notes as you learn more</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Link your HTML document and your .css document by using the <.link> tag in your header </li>
          <li>You can apply CSS changes by either listing each element out and their changes individually, or by affecting everything in the document, or by classifying groups, and doing it by group, always be sure to use the most code effecient method, and to not repeat your code</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that tracks the changes and version history of a source code during software development</li>
          <li>Git allows multiple developers to work on the same code concurrently</li>
          <li>Some common bit commands you will use are: git clone <.repo> creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git status: shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or stages, </li>
          <li>gid add <.file>: adds an untracked or modified file to the staging area</li>
          <li>give commit -m <.message>: commits the staged changes with a descriptive message</li>
          <li>git push: pushes the commited changes to the remote repository</li>
          <li>git pull: fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into the current branch</li>
          <li>git branch: lists all the local branches</li>
          <li>You will use git by creating your own 'branch' isolated from the main code to add/edit code, without it impacting the rest of the main code, when you have completed your work, it gets checked by other developers on the team, and then once approved, merged into the main code, and your branch is deleted.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is the coding language used to build the functions of the website</li>
          <li>Enter more notes as you learn more about javascript </li>
          <li>JavaScript executes code top down, so it is important to remember to have certain code in the correct order to make it function, this is called control flow</li>
          <li>Use var to declare variables</li>
          <li>We use if, for and function statements to organize the logic behind our website</li>
          <li>Function loops are declared, and then can be called upon later in the code, just like in c++</li>
          <li>For loops work like c++ loops, except for the variable decleration (var i = 0)</li>
          <li>Console.log is used to print material to the console</li>
          <li>We can use the math.foor and math.random as a part of javascripts built in math object to generate random numbers</li>
